# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Problem Overview
In today’s highly competitive market, retaining customers is crucial for business sustainability. This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning, meaning they may stop using the service. Losing customers can result in revenue loss and reduced market presence. By utilizing machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a model that analyzes customer behavior, demographics, and subscription details to predict churn. This will allow businesses to take proactive steps, such as personalized retention strategies, to improve customer satisfaction, lower churn rates, and refine overall business strategies. The objective is to create a data-driven solution that fosters long-term customer engagement and loyalty.

Dataset Description
The dataset includes various attributes that help in predicting customer churn. The key columns are:

CustomerID – A unique identifier for each customer.
Name – Customer's full name.

Age – The age of the customer.

Gender – Customer’s gender (Male or Female).

Location – The geographical region of the customer (Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, New York).

Subscription_Length_Months – The duration (in months) the customer has been subscribed.

Monthly_Bill – The monthly charge for the customer’s subscription.

Total_Usage_GB – The total data usage by the customer in gigabytes.

Churn – A binary label indicating if the customer has churned (1 for churn, 0 for retained).

Technology Stack

Programming Language:

Python – The primary language used for data analysis, modeling, and implementing machine learning algorithms due to its extensive ecosystem of libraries.
Libraries and Tools:

Pandas – Used for handling and analyzing structured data.
NumPy – Provides support for numerical computing and mathematical operations.

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score – Standard classification metrics to assess model effectiveness.
Confusion Matrix – Analyzes true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates.
ROC Curve & AUC (Area Under Curve) – Measures model performance in distinguishing between churned and retained customers.
Expected Outcome
The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a reliable predictive model that helps identify customers who are likely to churn based on their subscription details, usage behavior, and demographics. By accurately forecasting churn, businesses can implement targeted strategies to retain at-risk customers, improve satisfaction, and optimize resource allocation. The insights derived from this model will support data-driven decision-making, leading to a significant reduction in customer attrition and a stronger, more engaged customer base.
